                                In India, company registration is also referred to as incorporation of 
                                company or formation of a business. Registering your company makes your business a 
                                distinguished entity and gives it a legal existence. The company registration process in India is 
                                done under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. According to the statistics, nearly 7 lakh 
                                companies are registered in India and new applications are being filed every day. We take care 
                                of all legal formalities and comply with all Ministry of Corporate Affairs requirements. You can 
                                obtain a Certificate of Incorporation, as well as your PAN and TAN, once the company 
                                registration process has been approved.

                                One Person Company (OPC) has been recently introduced in India to 
                                promote business enterprises that are owned and managed by a single Entrepreneur. Corporate 
                                entities like Limited Liability Partnership, Private Limited Company and Limited Company require 
                                two or more people to partner. However, a OPC allows for a single individual to own and 
                                manage the business. One Person Company is therefore a viable option for those looking to 
                                start an unregistered Proprietorship. In this article, we compare starting and managing a One

                                promote business enterprises that are owned and managed by a single Entrepreneur. Corporate 
                                entities like Limited Liability Partnership, Private Limited Company and Limited Company require 
                                two or more people to partner. However, a OPC allows for a single individual to own and 
                                manage the business. One Person Company is therefore a viable option for those looking to 
                                start an unregistered Proprietorship. In this article, we compare starting and managing a One

                                One Person Company (OPC) has been recently introduced in India to 
                                promote business enterprises that are owned and managed by a single Entrepreneur. Corporate 
                                entities like Limited Liability Partnership, Private Limited Company and Limited Company require 
                                two or more people to partner. However, a OPC allows for a single individual to own and 
                                manage the business. One Person Company is therefore a viable option for those looking to 
                                start an unregistered Proprietorship. In this article, we compare starting and managing a One 
                                Person Company vs Private Limited Company in India.

                                company or formation of a business. Registering your company makes your business a 
                                distinguished entity and gives it a legal existence. The company registration process in India is 
                                done under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. According to the statistics, nearly 7 lakh 
                                companies are registered in India and new applications are being filed every day. We take care 
                                of all legal formalities and comply with all Ministry of Corporate Affairs requirements. You can

                                One Person Company (OPC) has been recently introduced in India to 
                                promote business enterprises that are owned and managed by a single Entrepreneur. Corporate 
                                entities like Limited Liability Partnership, Private Limited Company and Limited Company require 
                                two or more people to partner. However, a OPC allows for a single individual to own and 
                                manage the business. One Person Company is therefore a viable option for those looking to 
                                start an unregistered Proprietorship. In this article, we compare starting and managing a One

                                company or formation of a business. Registering your company makes your business a 
                                distinguished entity and gives it a legal existence. The company registration process in India is 
                                done under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. According to the statistics, nearly 7 lakh 
                                companies are registered in India and new applications are being filed every day. We take care 
                                of all legal formalities and comply with all Ministry of Corporate Affairs requirements. You can

                                One Person Company (OPC) has been recently introduced in India to 
                                promote business enterprises that are owned and managed by a single Entrepreneur. Corporate 
                                entities like Limited Liability Partnership, Private Limited Company and Limited Company require 
                                two or more people to partner. However, a OPC allows for a single individual to own and 
                                manage the business. One Person Company is therefore a viable option for those looking to 
                                start an unregistered Proprietorship. In this article, we compare starting and managing a One 
                                Person Company vs Private Limited Company in India.
