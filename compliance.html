                              to the number of shares held by them. The shareholders cannot be held liable beyond the value 
                              of the shares. The governing body for such a company is the Ministry of Corporate Affairs

                              A company where 50% or more of its equity shares are owned by a foreign 
                              company is a foreign subsidiary company. The foreign company in such case is called the holding 
                              company or the parent company.Compliance's are based on the company that is incorporated. 
                              Hence, it is necessary to understand what complaisance are supposed to be met according to 
                              the type of the company, the operations of the industry, annual turnover, number of 
                              employees, etc.Foreign subsidiary companies are mandatory required to maintain compliance 
                              according to the Income Tax Act, Companies Act, Transfer pricing guidelines, and FEMA 
                              guidelines.The foreign subsidiary compliance includes income tax filing with the income tax 
                              department, annual return with the ministry of corporate affairs, and other filings with the 
                              authorities like the Reserve Bank of India or the securities and exchange board of India (SEBI).All 
                              the companies even foreign subsidiaries will have to comply with other Indian tax regulations 
                              like the TDS, GST regulation, PF regulation, ESI regulations, and others. The compliance 
                              requirement for a foreign subsidiary company would differ based on the industry, state of 
                              incorporation, number of employees, and sales turnover.Foreign Direct Investment of up to 
                              100% is allowed into an Indian private limited company and limited company for most of the 
                              sector. The amount of FDI in India has increased manifold over the last few years due to a 
                              booming economy and welcoming environment for foreign investors.
