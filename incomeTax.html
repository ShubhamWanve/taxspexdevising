                              Tax Deducted at Source or TDS is a type of advance tax which is deducted from the earnings of an individual or an organization before the money is actually credited into that entity’s account, according to the Indian Taxation Code. The government is able to generate revenues by implementing the provisions of TDS on the earnings of individuals as well as businesses. Rules and regulations regarding TDS are controlled and governed under the Income Tax Act, 1961 by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).As the name suggests, “Tax Deducted at Source” implies that the payee or the employer deducts the tax before making a payment to the receiver. Tax Deducted at Source is applicable on income earned regularly and also on the income earned occasionally or irregularly. Thus, TDS is applicable on various incomes, including, but not limited to Salary, Commission, Rent, Professional Fees and Interest.
